# Copilot Instructions for roarm-grid-poc

## Repository Overview

This is a proof-of-concept (POC) repository for the roarm-grid project. The purpose is to explore and validate concepts, architectures, and approaches before implementing them in the main project.

## General Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality standards
- **Documentation**: Document code clearly with comments where necessary
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- **Testing**: Write tests for new functionality when applicable

## Code Style Conventions

- Follow language-specific best practices and idioms
- Use consistent formatting throughout the codebase
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches for new work
2. Test changes locally before committing
3. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
4. Submit pull requests for review

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Project-Specific Patterns

- This is a POC repository, so experimental approaches are encouraged
- Document assumptions and decisions in code comments
- Keep changes isolated and easy to understand
- Focus on demonstrating concepts clearly

## Build and Deployment

- Follow standard build practices for the technology stack used
- Document any special build requirements
- Include setup instructions in README.md when necessary

## Additional Notes

- Since this is a proof-of-concept, prioritize clarity and demonstrability over production-readiness
- Feel free to experiment with different approaches
- Document findings and insights for future reference
